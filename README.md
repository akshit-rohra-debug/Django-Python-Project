# Mini-project: Product Insight (A django-based web application)

Objective of this project was to create a web-application that;
 - Fetches tweets for any given product keyword from Twitter (using it's open REST APIs)
 - Cleans and pre-processes the fetched data and saves it as an SQL table
 - Trains a Naive-Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis using the data
 - And provides valuable visualization reports for the sentiment analysis
